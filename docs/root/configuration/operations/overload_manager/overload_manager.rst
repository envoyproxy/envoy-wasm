Overload manager
================

The :ref:`overload manager <arch_overview_overload_manager>` is configured in the Bootstrap
:ref:`overload_manager <envoy_api_field_config.bootstrap.v2.Bootstrap.overload_manager>`
field.

An example configuration of the overload manager is shown below. It shows a configuration to
disable HTTP/1.x keepalive when heap memory usage reaches 95% and to stop accepting
requests when heap memory usage reaches 99%.

.. code-block:: yaml

   refresh_interval:
     seconds: 0
     nanos: 250000000
   resource_monitors:
     - name: "envoy.resource_monitors.fixed_heap"
       config:
         max_heap_size_bytes: 2147483648
   actions:
     - name: "envoy.overload_actions.disable_http_keepalive"
       triggers:
         - name: "envoy.resource_monitors.fixed_heap"
           threshold:
             value: 0.95
     - name: "envoy.overload_actions.stop_accepting_requests"
       triggers:
         - name: "envoy.resource_monitors.fixed_heap"
           threshold:
             value: 0.99

Resource monitors
-----------------

The overload manager uses Envoy's :ref:`extension <extending>` framework for defining
resource monitors. Envoy's builtin resource monitors are listed
:ref:`here <config_resource_monitors>`.

Overload actions
----------------

The following overload actions are supported:

.. csv-table::
  :header: Name, Description
  :widths: 1, 2

  envoy.overload_actions.stop_accepting_requests, Envoy will immediately respond with a 503 response code to new requests
  envoy.overload_actions.disable_http_keepalive, Envoy will disable keepalive on HTTP/1.x responses
  envoy.overload_actions.stop_accepting_connections, Envoy will stop accepting new network connections on its configured listeners
  envoy.overload_actions.shrink_heap, Envoy will periodically try to shrink the heap by releasing free memory to the system

Statistics
----------

Each configured resource monitor has a statistics tree rooted at *overload.<name>.*
with the following statistics:

.. csv-table::
  :header: Name, Type, Description
  :widths: 1, 1, 2

  pressure, Gauge, Resource pressure as a percent
  failed_updates, Counter, Total failed attempts to update the resource pressure
  skipped_updates, Counter, Total skipped attempts to update the resource pressure due to a pending update

Each configured overload action has a statistics tree rooted at *overload.<name>.*
with the following statistics:

.. csv-table::
  :header: Name, Type, Description
  :widths: 1, 1, 2

  active, Gauge, "Active state of the action (0=inactive, 1=active)"
