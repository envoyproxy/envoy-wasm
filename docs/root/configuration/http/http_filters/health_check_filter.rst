Health check
============

* Health check filter :ref:`architecture overview <arch_overview_health_checking_filter>`
* :ref:`v3 API reference <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.health_check.v3.HealthCheck>`
* This filter should be configured with the name *envoy.filters.http.health_check*.

.. note::

  Note that the filter will automatically fail health checks and set the
  :ref:`x-envoy-immediate-health-check-fail
  <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-immediate-health-check-fail>` header if the
  :ref:`/healthcheck/fail <operations_admin_interface_healthcheck_fail>` admin endpoint has been
  called. (The :ref:`/healthcheck/ok <operations_admin_interface_healthcheck_ok>` admin endpoint
  reverses this behavior).
