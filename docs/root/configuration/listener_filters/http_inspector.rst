HTTP Inspector
==============

HTTP Inspector listener filter allows detecting whether the application protocol appears to be HTTP, 
and if it is HTTP, it detects the HTTP protocol (HTTP/1.x or HTTP/2) further. This can be used to select a
:ref:`FilterChain <envoy_api_msg_listener.FilterChain>` via the :ref:`application_protocols <envoy_api_field_listener.FilterChainMatch.application_protocols>`
of a :ref:`FilterChainMatch <envoy_api_msg_listener.FilterChainMatch>`.

* :ref:`v2 API reference <envoy_api_field_listener.ListenerFilter.name>`
* This filter should be configured with the name *envoy.listener.http_inspector*.

Example
-------

A sample filter configuration could be:

.. code-block:: yaml

  listener_filters:
    - name: "envoy.listener.http_inspector"
      typed_config: {}
