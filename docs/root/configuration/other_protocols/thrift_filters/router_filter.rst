Router
======

The router filter implements Thrift forwarding. It will be used in almost all Thrift proxying
scenarios. The filter's main job is to follow the instructions specified in the configured
:ref:`route table <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.thrift_proxy.v3.RouteConfiguration>`.

* :ref:`v3 API reference <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.filter.thrift.router.v2alpha1.Router>`
* This filter should be configured with the name *envoy.filters.thrift.router*.

Statistics
----------

The filter outputs statistics in the *thrift.<stat_prefix>.* namespace.
