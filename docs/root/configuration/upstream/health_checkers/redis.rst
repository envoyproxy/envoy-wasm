Redis
=====

The Redis health checker is a custom health checker (with :code:`envoy.health_checkers.redis` as name)
which checks Redis upstream hosts. It sends a Redis PING command and expect a PONG response. The upstream
Redis server can respond with anything other than PONG to cause an immediate active health check failure.
Optionally, Envoy can perform EXISTS on a user-specified key. If the key does not exist it is considered a
passing health check. This allows the user to mark a Redis instance for maintenance by setting the
specified :ref:`key <envoy_api_field_config.health_checker.redis.v2.Redis.key>` to any value and waiting
for traffic to drain.

An example setting for :ref:`custom_health_check <envoy_api_msg_core.HealthCheck.CustomHealthCheck>` as a
Redis health checker is shown below:

.. code-block:: yaml

  custom_health_check:
    name: envoy.health_checkers.redis
      typed_config:
        "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.filter.network.redis_proxy.v2.RedisProxy
        key: foo

* :ref:`v2 API reference <envoy_api_msg_core.HealthCheck.CustomHealthCheck>`
