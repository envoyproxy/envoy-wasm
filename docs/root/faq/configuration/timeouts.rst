How do I configure timeouts?
============================

Envoy supports a wide range of timeouts that may need to be configured depending on the deployment.
This page summarizes the most important timeouts used in various scenarios.

.. attention::

  This is not an exhaustive list of all of the configurable timeouts that Envoy supports. Depending
  on the deployment additional configuration may be required.

HTTP/gRPC
---------

Connection timeouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connection timeouts apply to the entire HTTP connection and all streams the connection carries.

* The HTTP protocol :ref:`idle timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.idle_timeout>`
  is defined in a generic message used by both the HTTP connection manager as well as upstream
  cluster HTTP connections. The idle timeout is the time at which a downstream or upstream
  connection will be terminated if there are no active streams. The default idle timeout if not
  otherwise specified is *1 hour*. To modify the idle timeout for downstream connections use the
  :ref:`common_http_protocol_options
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.common_http_protocol_options>`
  field in the HTTP connection manager configuration. To modify the idle timeout for upstream
  connections use the
  :ref:`common_http_protocol_options <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.common_http_protocol_options>` field
  in the cluster configuration.

Stream timeouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stream timeouts apply to individual streams carried by an HTTP connection. Note that a stream is
an HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 concept, however internally Envoy maps HTTP/1 requests to streams so in this
context request/stream is interchangeable.

* The HTTP connection manager :ref:`request_timeout
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.request_timeout>`
  is the amount of time the connection manager will allow for the *entire request stream* to be
  received from the client.

  .. attention::

    This timeout is not enforced by default as it is not compatible with streaming requests
    (requests that never end). See the stream idle timeout that follows. However, if using the
    :ref:`buffer filter <config_http_filters_buffer>`, it is recommended to configure this timeout.
* The HTTP connection manager :ref:`stream_idle_timeout
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.stream_idle_timeout>`
  is the amount of time that the connection manager will allow a stream to exist with no upstream
  or downstream activity. The default stream idle timeout is *5 minutes*. This timeout is strongly
  recommended for streaming APIs (requests or responses that never end).
* The HTTP protocol :ref:`max_stream_duration <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.max_stream_duration>` 
  is defined in a generic message used by the HTTP connection manager. The max stream duration is the 
  maximum time that a stream's lifetime will span. You can use this functionality when you want to reset 
  HTTP request/response streams periodically. You can't use :ref:`request_timeout 
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.request_timeout>`
  in this situation because this timer will be disarmed if a response header is received on the request/response streams.
  This timeout is available on both upstream and downstream connections.

Route timeouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Envoy supports additional stream timeouts at the route level, as well as overriding some of the
stream timeouts already introduced above.

* A route :ref:`timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.timeout>` is the amount of time that
  Envoy will wait for the upstream to respond with a complete response. *This timeout does not
  start until the entire downstream request stream has been received*.

  .. attention::

    This timeout defaults to *15 seconds*, however, it is not compatible with streaming responses
    (responses that never end), and will need to be disabled. Stream idle timeouts should be used
    in the case of streaming APIs as described elsewhere on this page.
* The route :ref:`idle_timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.idle_timeout>` allows overriding
  of the HTTP connection manager :ref:`stream_idle_timeout
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.stream_idle_timeout>`
  and does the same thing.
* The route :ref:`per_try_timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RetryPolicy.per_try_timeout>` can be
  configured when using retries so that individual tries using a shorter timeout than the overall
  request timeout described above. This timeout only applies before any part of the response
  is sent to the downstream, which normally happens after the upstream has sent response headers.
  This timeout can be used with streaming endpoints to retry if the upstream fails to begin a
  response within the timeout.

TCP
---

* The cluster :ref:`connect_timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.connect_timeout>` specifies the amount
  of time Envoy will wait for an upstream TCP connection to be established. This timeout has no
  default, but is required in the configuration.

  .. attention::

    For TLS connections, the connect timeout includes the TLS handshake.
* The TCP proxy :ref:`idle_timeout
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.idle_timeout>`
  is the amount of time that the TCP proxy will allow a connection to exist with no upstream
  or downstream activity. The default idle timeout if not otherwise specified is *1 hour*.
