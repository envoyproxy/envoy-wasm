# Building documentation locally

There are two methods to build the documentation, described below.

In both cases, the generated output can be found in `generated/docs`.

## Building in an existing Envoy development environment

If you have an [existing Envoy development environment](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/tree/master/bazel#quick-start-bazel-build-for-developers), you should have the necessary dependencies and requirements and be able to build the documentation directly.

```bash
./docs/build.sh
```

By default configuration examples are going to be validated during build. To disable validation,
set `SPHINX_SKIP_CONFIG_VALIDATION` environment variable to `true`:

```bash
SPHINX_SKIP_CONFIG_VALIDATION=true docs/build.sh
```

## Using the Docker build container to build the documentation

If you *do not* have an existing development environment, you may wish to use the Docker build
image that is used in continuous integration.

This can be done as follows:

```
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'docs/build.sh'
```

To use this method you will need a minimum of 4-5GB of disk space available to accommodate the build image.

# Creating a Pull Request with documentation changes

When you create a Pull Request the documentation is rendered by CircleCI.

If you are logged in to CircleCI (it is possible to authenticate using your Github account), you can view
the rendered changes.

To do this:
- click `Details` in the `ci/circleci: docs` check at the bottom of the Pull Request.
- click `ARTIFACTS` in the CircleCI dashboard
- browse to the documentation root at `generated/docs/index.html`.

# How the Envoy website and docs are updated

1. The docs are published to [docs/envoy/latest](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoyproxy.github.io/tree/master/docs/envoy/latest)
   on every commit to master. This process is handled by CircleCI with the
  [`publish.sh`](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/docs/publish.sh) script.

2. The docs are published to [docs/envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoyproxy.github.io/tree/master/docs/envoy)
   in a directory named after every tagged commit in this repo. Thus, on every tagged release there
   are snapped docs.
