# Script to rebuild Dockerfile-envoy-google-vrp locally (i.e. not in CI) for development purposes.
# This makes use of the latest envoy-dev base image on Docker Hub as the base and takes an
# optional local path for an Envoy binary. When a custom local Envoy binary is used, the script
# switches to using ${BASE_DOCKER_IMAGE} for the build, which should be configured to provide
# compatibility with your local build environment (specifically glibc).
#
# Usage:
#
# Basic rebuild of Docker image (tagged envoy-google-vrp:local):
#
#   ./ci/docker_rebuild_google-vrp.sh
#
# Basic rebuild of Docker image (tagged envoy-google-vrp:local) with some local Envoy binary:
#
#   bazel build //source/exe:envoy-static --config=libc++ -copt
#   ./ci/docker_rebuild_google-vrp.sh bazel-bin/source/exe/envoy-static

# Don't use the local envoy-dev, but pull from Docker Hub instead, this avoids having to rebuild
# this local dep which is fairly stable.
