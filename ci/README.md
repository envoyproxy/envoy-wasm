# Developer use of CI Docker images

Two flavors of Envoy Docker images, based on Ubuntu and Alpine Linux, are built.

## Ubuntu Envoy image
The Ubuntu based Envoy Docker image at [`envoyproxy/envoy-build:<hash>`](https://hub.docker.com/r/envoyproxy/envoy-build/) is used for CircleCI checks,
where `<hash>` is specified in [`envoy_build_sha.sh`](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/ci/envoy_build_sha.sh). Developers
may work with `envoyproxy/envoy-build:latest` to provide a self-contained environment for building Envoy binaries and
running tests that reflects the latest built Ubuntu Envoy image. Moreover, the Docker image
at [`envoyproxy/envoy:<hash>`](https://hub.docker.com/r/envoyproxy/envoy/) is an image that has an Envoy binary at `/usr/local/bin/envoy`. The `<hash>`
corresponds to the master commit at which the binary was compiled. Lastly, `envoyproxy/envoy-dev:latest` contains an Envoy
binary built from the latest tip of master that passed tests.

## Alpine Envoy image

Minimal images based on Alpine Linux allow for quicker deployment of Envoy. Two Alpine based images are built,
one with an Envoy binary with debug (`envoyproxy/envoy-alpine-debug`) symbols and one stripped of them (`envoyproxy/envoy-alpine`).
Both images are pushed with two different tags: `<hash>` and `latest`. Parallel to the Ubuntu images above, `<hash>` corresponds to the
master commit at which the binary was compiled, and `latest` corresponds to a binary built from the latest tip of master that passed tests.

# Build image base and compiler versions

Currently there are three build images:

* `envoyproxy/envoy-build` &mdash; alias to `envoyproxy/envoy-build-ubuntu`.
* `envoyproxy/envoy-build-ubuntu` &mdash; based on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) with GCC 7 and Clang 8 compiler.
* `envoyproxy/envoy-build-centos` &mdash; based on CentOS 7 with GCC 7 and Clang 8 compiler, this image is experimental and not well tested.

We use the Clang compiler for all CI runs with tests. We have an additional CI run with GCC which builds binary only.

# Building and running tests as a developer

An example basic invocation to build a developer version of the Envoy static binary (using the Bazel `fastbuild` type) is:

```bash
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh './ci/do_ci.sh bazel.dev'
```

The build image defaults to `envoyproxy/envoy-build-ubuntu`, but you can choose build image by setting `IMAGE_NAME` in the environment.

In case your setup is behind a proxy, set `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` to the proxy servers before invoking the build.

```bash
IMAGE_NAME=envoyproxy/envoy-build-ubuntu http_proxy=http://proxy.foo.com:8080 https_proxy=http://proxy.bar.com:8080 ./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh './ci/do_ci.sh bazel.dev'
```

The Envoy binary can be found in `/tmp/envoy-docker-build/envoy/source/exe/envoy-fastbuild` on the Docker host. You
can control this by setting `ENVOY_DOCKER_BUILD_DIR` in the environment, e.g. to
generate the binary in `~/build/envoy/source/exe/envoy-fastbuild` you can run:

```bash
ENVOY_DOCKER_BUILD_DIR=~/build ./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh './ci/do_ci.sh bazel.dev'
```

For a release version of the Envoy binary you can run:

```bash
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh './ci/do_ci.sh bazel.release.server_only'
```

The build artifact can be found in `/tmp/envoy-docker-build/envoy/source/exe/envoy` (or wherever
`$ENVOY_DOCKER_BUILD_DIR` points).

For a debug version of the Envoy binary you can run:

```bash
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh './ci/do_ci.sh bazel.debug.server_only'
```

The build artifact can be found in `/tmp/envoy-docker-build/envoy/source/exe/envoy-debug` (or wherever
`$ENVOY_DOCKER_BUILD_DIR` points).

To leverage a [bazel remote cache](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/tree/master/bazel#advanced-caching-setup) add the http_remote_cache endpoint to
the BAZEL_BUILD_EXTRA_OPTIONS environment variable

```bash
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh "BAZEL_BUILD_EXTRA_OPTIONS='--remote_http_cache=http://127.0.0.1:28080' ./ci/do_ci.sh bazel.release"
```

* `bazel.api` &mdash; build and run API tests under `-c fastbuild` with clang.
* `bazel.asan` &mdash; build and run tests under `-c dbg --config=clang-asan` with clang.

# Testing changes to the build image as a developer

While all changes to the build image should eventually be upstreamed, it can be useful to
test those changes locally before sending out a pull request. To experiment
with a local clone of the upstream build image you can make changes to files such as
build_container.sh locally and then run:

```bash
DISTRO=ubuntu
cd ci/build_container
LINUX_DISTRO="${DISTRO}" CIRCLE_SHA1=my_tag ./docker_build.sh  # Wait patiently for quite some time
cd ../..
IMAGE_NAME="envoyproxy/envoy-build-${DISTRO}" IMAGE_ID=my_tag ./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh './ci/do_ci.sh bazel.whatever'
```

This build the Ubuntu based `envoyproxy/envoy-build-ubuntu` image, and the final call will run against your local copy of the build image.

# macOS Build Flow

The macOS CI build is part of the [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/envoyproxy/envoy) workflow.
Dependencies are installed by the `ci/mac_ci_setup.sh` script, via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh),
which is pre-installed on the CircleCI macOS image. The dependencies are cached are re-installed
on every build. The `ci/mac_ci_steps.sh` script executes the specific commands that
build and test Envoy. If Envoy cannot be built (`error: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/libtool: no output file specified (specify with -o output)`),
ensure that XCode is installed.

# Coverity Scan Build Flow

[Coverity Scan Envoy Project](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/envoy-proxy)

Coverity Scan static analysis is not run within Envoy CI. However, Envoy can be locally built and
submitted for analysis. A Coverity Scan Envoy project token must be generated from the
[Coverity Project Settings](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/envoy-proxy?tab=project_settings).
Only a Coverity Project Administrator can create a token. With this token, running
`ci/do_coverity_local.sh` will use the Ubuntu based `envoyproxy/envoy-build-ubuntu` image to build the
Envoy static binary with the Coverity Scan tool chain. This process generates an artifact,
envoy-coverity-output.tgz, that is uploaded to Coverity for static analysis.

To build and submit for analysis:
```bash
COVERITY_TOKEN={generated Coverity project token} ./ci/do_coverity_local.sh
```
